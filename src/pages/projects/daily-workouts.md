title: "Daily Workouts App"
info:
  Personal project to collate various YouTube workout videos into a single app, providing recommendations and minimizing the friction involved in working out.

  The front-end is built using React.js and Material UI, while the back-end is powered by Firebase. The app is hosted on Netlify and the project is publicly available on GitHub.
