## Introduction
As part of my final year university studies, I was required to complete a capstone project. The capstone project is a culmination of all the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout my degree. I was required to work in a team of 4 to develop a solution to a real-world problem. The project was to be completed over 2 semesters following the agile methodology and using the scrum framework.

Our team landed with a local startup called HOSPFLOW, hoping to develop an MVP for their hospitality management app which would streamline daily operations in the hospitality industry.


## The Problem
Hospitality management involves juggling various tasks, from handling suppliers and managing inventory to placing orders and coordinating with your team. Traditional methods often rely on manual processes, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and a lack of scalability. Many businesses struggle with:

### Supplier Management
- **Complex Processes:** Adding, updating, and managing suppliers can be cumbersome and prone to errors.
- **Inventory Challenges:** Keeping track of supplier inventories and searching for specific products is time-consuming.

### Order Placement
- **Tedious Procedures:** Placing orders can involve multiple steps, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Whiteboard Management:** Traditional methods may require maintaining physical whiteboards for order tracking.

### Team Coordination
- **Communication Gaps:** Coordinating with team members, managers, and staff can be challenging.
- **Access Limitations:** Traditional systems may not provide the flexibility of managing operations from anywhere.
